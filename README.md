# Twitter / X scraper

## How to use this:

Copy the script from `scrape.js` and paste it into the devtools console on x.com. You can then call the `extractTweets` function with the number of tweets you want to extract. Once finished it will trigger downloading a CSV of all the tweets. It will also return the tweets as JSON.

Happy scraping!
